This release sees a cleaner UI in the preference pane and automatic text window resizing.

After updating, you should stop and start HeadsUp.

h3. Features

* Window sizes are now completely based on (and refreshed with) their text contents; no more string-padding / right-alignment hacks!
* Start/Stop now also sets/forgets Start at Login. (No sense having 2 things to click when 1 will suffice.)
* Removed option for automatic Sparkle updates. (Chose a default: they're turned off.)
