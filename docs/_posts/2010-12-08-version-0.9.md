HeadsUp is now a standalone application!

If you have the old preference pane installed, you'll probably want to remove
it first.

There's more to come. I'd like to make an option to disable the status menu
item, and to re-enable starting HeadsUp at login. For now, though, it's time to
ship it!

### Changelog

* HeadsUp is a standalone application, not a preference pane.
* No more RubyCocoa, just straight-up Objective-C.
* Option to start at login temporarily removed.
* Font changed from Monaco to Menlo.
